# The Next Palindrome (Codechef - Medium)
A positive integer is called a palindrome if its representation in the decimal system is the same when read from left to right and from right to left. For a given positive integer K of not more than 1000000 digits, write the value of the smallest palindrome larger than K to output. Numbers are always displayed without leading zeros.<br>

### Input<br>
The first line contains integer t, the number of test cases. Followed by t lines containing integers K.<br>

### Output<br>
For each K, output the smallest palindrome larger than K.<br>

### Example<br>
#### Input:<br>
2<br>
808<br>
2133<br>
#### Output:<br>
818<br>
